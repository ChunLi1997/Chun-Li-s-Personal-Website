# My Recipes
### Cooking is my biggest hobby. As a PCOS fighter for over 10 years, I used to struggle with my eating until I found the correct nutrition plan to manage my symptoms. Now I lead a low-GI, low Gluten, and diary-free Asian-inspired clean diet style to manage my cycle, insulin, weight, and mood. I'd love to share some of my recipes with y'all! I hope they can bring some yummy inspirations to people who have similar insulin/PCOS/weight issues. 
### Zucchini Pancake: Vegetarian Friendly + Low Gluten (Gluten Free Version is coming!) + My Breakfast Favorite!!! 
### Ingredients:

2 medium green zucchinis,

1 cup of wheat flour/gluten floor,

3 medium eggs,

2 teaspoon of garlic powder,

1/2 teaspoon of white pepper powder,

1 teaspoon of Chinese five-spice powder,

1 teaspoon of sea salt,

a little bit of chicken powder seasoning (skip this step if you want a 100% vegetarian pancake)
### Directions:
1. Prepare your zucchinis: Rinse zucchinis and peel them (many zucchini recipes tend to keep the skin because of the nutrients, but I'd love to peel them for a smooth pancake batter).
2. Scrub the zucchini with a simple handheld cheese grater into a mixing bowl. Watch out for your fingers!
3. Crack eggs into the bowl, add the rest of ingredients and stir, until everything is mixed and smooth;
4. Place a nonstick pan on the stovetop, turn the heat on, and add 1/2 teaspoon of olive oil. Spread the oil across the food on a flat pan surface. 
5. Give it a couple of minutes, then pour the pancake batter on the pan. Consider using a measuring cup so you won't make a mess. How much batter for a pancake depends on the size of your pan. Basically, I would make a pancake as big as my pan size so that I can get a perfect round size. Start pouring from the middle and spread it until it covers the whole pan. Don't rush, give it medium heat and wait for 2-3 minutes.
6. Use your chopstick to touch the bottom of the pancake, if it becomes solid and removable, try to flip it with a good, plastic/wooden/bamboo spatula and slide it underneath the pancake. If you still feel it's soft and floating, allow the pancakes to cook properly!
7. After you flip it, check the color of the pancake surface. The perfect zucchini should be beautiful golden and brown, and of course, some green. You want to make two sides even and have the same color.
8. Serve the pancake with vinegar and minced garlic. Or enjoy plain!
