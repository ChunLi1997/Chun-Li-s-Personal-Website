# My Recipes
## Cooking is my biggest hobby. As a PCOS fighter over 10 years, I used to struggle with my eating until I found the correct nutrition plan to manage my symptoms. Now I lead a low-GI, low Gluten, and diary free Asian inspired clean diet style to management my cycle, insulin, weight, and mood. I'd love to share some of my recipes with y'all! I hope they can bring some yummy inspirations to people who have similar insulin/PCOS/weight issues. 
### Zucchini Pancake: Vegetarian Friendly + Low Gluten (Gluten Free Version is coming!) + My Breakfast Favorite!!! 
### Ingredents:

2 medium green zucchinis,

1 cup of wheat flour/gluten floor,

3 medium eggs,

2 teaspoon of garlic powder,

1/2 teaspoon of white pepper powder,

1 teaspoon of Chinese five-spice powder,

1 teaspoon of sea salt,

a little bit of chicken powder seasoing (skip this step if you want a 100% vegertarian pancake)
### Directions:
1. Prepare your zucchinis: Rinse zucchinis and peel them (many zucchini recipes tend to keep the skin because of the nutrients, but I'd love to peel them for a smooth pancake batter).
2. Scrub the zucchinis with a simple handheld cheese grater into a mixing bowl. Watch out your fingers!
3. Crack eggs into the bowl, add the rest of ingredents and stir, until everything mixed and smooth;
4. Place a nonstick pan on the stovetop, turn the heat on and add 1/2 teaspoon of olive oil. Spreading the oil across food on a flat pan surface. 
5. Give it a couple of mintues, then pour the pancake batter on the pan. Conside use a measuring cup so you won't make a mess. How much batter for a pancake depends on the size of your pan. Basically I would make a pancake as big as my pan size so that I can get a perfect round size. Start pouring from the middle and spread it until it cover the whole pan. Don't rush, give it medium heat and wait for 2-3 minutes.
6. Use your a chopstick to touch bottom of the pancake, if it become solid and removable, try to flip it with a good, plastic/wooden/bamboo spatula and slide it underneath the pancake. If you still feel it's soft and floating, allow the pancakes to cook properly!
7. After your flip it, check the color of the pancake surface. The perfect zucchinis should be beautiful golden and brown, and of course, some green. You want to make two sides even and have same color.
8. Serve the pancake with vinegar and minced garlic. Or enjoy plain!
